# React Learnings

This project is ment to maintain some learnings about React. From classes to custom hooks.
If you want it to run:
- install axios
- need three API keys. Put them in src/files/ folder
  - google_API.js
  - unsplash_API.js
  - youtube_API.js

All of them have the same format, google API example:
```javascript
const google_API = 'your google API';

export default google_API;
```
